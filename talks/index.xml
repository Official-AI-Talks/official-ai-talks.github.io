Abstract We present Bit Diffusion: a simple and generic approach for generating discrete data with continuous diffusion models. The main idea behind our approach is to first represent the discrete data as binary bits, and then train a continuous diffusion model to model these bits as real numbers which we call analog bits.</description>
