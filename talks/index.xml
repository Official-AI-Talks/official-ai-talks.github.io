      <description>Speaker Bio: Chunyuan Li is currently a Principal Researcher in the Deep Learning Team at Microsoft Research, Redmond. Before that, Chunyuan obtained his PhD at Duke University, working on probabilistic deep learning. He also spent time with Uber AI, Adobe Research, NIST and INRIA. At MSR, Chunyuan is mainly working on large-scale pre-training in computer vision (CV) and vision-language multimodality (MM), with a focus on building transferable vision models that can effortlessly generalize to a wide range of downstream CV &amp;amp; MM tasks.</description>
