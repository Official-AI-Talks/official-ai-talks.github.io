Abstract We present Bit Diffusion: a simple and generic approach for generating discrete data with continuous diffusion models. The main idea behind our approach is to first represent the discrete data as binary bits, and then train a continuous diffusion model to model these bits as real numbers which we call analog bits.</description>

      <description>Speaker Bio: Chunyuan Li is currently a Principal Researcher in the Deep Learning Team at Microsoft Research, Redmond. Before that, Chunyuan obtained his PhD at Duke University, working on probabilistic deep learning. He also spent time with Uber AI, Adobe Research, NIST and INRIA. At MSR, Chunyuan is mainly working on large-scale pre-training in computer vision (CV) and vision-language multimodality (MM), with a focus on building transferable vision models that can effortlessly generalize to a wide range of downstream CV &amp;amp; MM tasks.</description>
