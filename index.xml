      <description>Speaker Bio: Zifeng Wang is a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University. He received his B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University. His research interests include continual (lifelong) learning, data-efficient and parameter-efficient learning, adversarial robustness, and real-world machine learning applications.

Abstract The mainstream paradigm behind continual learning has been to adapt the model parameters to non-stationary data distributions, where catastrophic forgetting is the central challenge. In this talk, we present a new continual learning paradigm – Prompting-based Continual Learning, which learns a tiny set of parameters, called prompts, to properly instruct a pre-trained model to learn tasks arriving sequentially.</description>

      <description>Speaker Bio: Mitchell is a fourth year PhD student at the University of Washington. His research interests include large models, transfer learning, and robustness.
Homepage: https://mitchellnw.github.io/.
Abstract I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss methods for fine-tuning which improve model robustness and accuracy. These methods leverage the observation that fine-tuned models often appear to lie in a single low error region. To improve robustness, we therefore interpolate the weights of the pre-trained and fine-tuned models.</description>

Abstract Deep learning success is often associated with emblematic architectures. Almost everyone has heard of AlexNet, ResNet or GPT. These successes were also powered by well designed optimisation procedures, which are not usually central to the discussion.</description>

      <description>Speaker Bio: Ting Chen is a research scientist in the Google Brain team. His current research interests include self-supervised representation learning, generative modeling, efficient architectures and generalist learning principles. Before joining Google, he received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA.
Homepage: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KoXUMbsAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en.
Abstract We present Bit Diffusion: a simple and generic approach for generating discrete data with continuous diffusion models. The main idea behind our approach is to first represent the discrete data as binary bits, and then train a continuous diffusion model to model these bits as real numbers which we call analog bits.</description>
