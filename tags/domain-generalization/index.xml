      <description>Speaker Shiori Sagawa is a fourth-year PhD student at Stanford University, advised by Percy Liang. She studies robustness to distribution shifts, and to this end, she has developed methods based on distributionally robust optimization, analyzed these algorithms in the context of deep learning models, and recently built a benchmark on distribution shifts in the wild. She is an Apple PhD Scholar in AI/ML.

Abstract Machine learning models deployed in the real world constantly face distribution shifts, yet current models are not robust to these shifts; they can perform well when the train and test distributions are identical, but still have their performance plummet when evaluated on a different test distribution.</description>
