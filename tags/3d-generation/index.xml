      <description>Speaker Fangyin Wei is a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University, working with Szymon Rusinkiewicz and Thomas Funkhouser. Fangyinâ€™s research lies in the intersection of computer vision and graphics, with a goal of learning to build a realistic 3D world. Her past research spans topics from generative models for image synthesis/editing to neural renderers for 3D shape synthesis/editing, where she tackled various challenges from learning disentangled representations to learning without labels.</description>

      <description>Speaker Yinghao Xu is a final-year Ph.D. student at Multimedia Lab (MMLab), Department of Information Engineering in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. His supervisor is Prof. Dahua Lin and Prof. Bolei Zhou. He is very interested in generative models and neural rendering, particularly in 3D generative models. During his Ph.D., he is fortunate to visit Stanford computational group, working with Prof. Gordon Wetzstein. Many of his papers have been awarded as oral representation and best paper candidate at CVPR, ECCV, NeurIPS and ICLR.</description>
