      <description>Speaker Jack Hessel is a Research Scientist at the Allen Institute for AI. He previously earned a PhD from Cornell. These days, he works on improving human-AI collaboration. This includes aligning model behavior with human intent (RLHF), and expanding language models with new modalities (e.g., vision) for a more complete view of the world.
Abstract Algorithms that can jointly process modalities like images+text are needed for next generation search, accessibility, and robot interaction tools.</description>
