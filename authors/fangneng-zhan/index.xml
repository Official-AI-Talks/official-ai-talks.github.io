      <description>Speaker Fangneng Zhan is a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute for Informatics with Prof. Christian Theobalt. He received his Ph.D. degree of Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2021. His research interests are Neural Rendering and Generative Models (e.g., NeRF, 3D GAN, Diffusion Models). Aligning with the dictum of “What I cannot create, I do not understand” by Richard Feynman, his research goals are (1) Developing algorithms to synthesize and reconstruct the visual world and (2) Exploring how visual analysis can benefit from the advance of visual synthesis.</description>
