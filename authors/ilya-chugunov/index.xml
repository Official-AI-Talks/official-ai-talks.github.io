      <description>Speaker Ilya is a third year PhD Student in the Princeton University Computational Imaging Lab, advised by Professor Felix Heide, and is an NSF graduate research fellow. His work is at the intersection of computational photography, depth estimation, and designed optics research, modelling the image acquisition pipeline from signal collection to scene reconstruction.
Abstract Modern smartphones can continuously stream 12-megapixel 14-bit RAW images, LiDAR-driven low-resolution depth maps, accelerometer, and gyroscope measurements, estimated lens focal lengths, and a wide array of other camera metadata.</description>
