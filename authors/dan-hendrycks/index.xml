      <description>Speaker Dan Hendrycks is the director of the Center for AI Safety. He received his PhD from UC Berkeley, where he was advised by Jacob Steinhardt and Dawn Song. His research is supported by the NSF GRFP and the Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship. Dan contributed the GELU activation function, the default activation in nearly all state-of-the-art ML models including BERT, Vision Transformers, and GPT-3. Dan also contributed the main baseline for OOD detection and benchmarks for robustness (ImageNet-C) and large language models (MMLU, MATH).</description>
