Abstract I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss methods for fine-tuning which improve model robustness and accuracy. These methods leverage the observation that fine-tuned models often appear to lie in a single low error region. To improve robustness, we therefore interpolate the weights of the pre-trained and fine-tuned models.</description>
