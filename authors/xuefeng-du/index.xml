      <description>Speaker Xuefeng Du is a CS Ph.D. student at UW-Madison. His research focus is trustworthy machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, learning problem with label noise, out-of-distribution detection. He is also interested in neural architecture search, graph mining and high-level recognition models, such as object detection and segmentation.
Abstract Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is indispensable for deploying machine learning models in the wild. One of the key challenges in OOD detection is that models lack supervision signals from unknown data.</description>
