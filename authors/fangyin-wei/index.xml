      <description>Speaker Fangyin Wei is a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University, working with Szymon Rusinkiewicz and Thomas Funkhouser. Fangyinâ€™s research lies in the intersection of computer vision and graphics, with a goal of learning to build a realistic 3D world. Her past research spans topics from generative models for image synthesis/editing to neural renderers for 3D shape synthesis/editing, where she tackled various challenges from learning disentangled representations to learning without labels.</description>
