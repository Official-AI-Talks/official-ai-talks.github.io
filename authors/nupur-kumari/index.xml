      <description>Speaker Nupur Kumari is a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Jun-Yan Zhu. Her research is in generative models, specifically efficient fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques to improve generative models.
Abstract Advancements in large-scale generative models represent a watershed moment. These models can generate a wide variety of objects, styles, and scenes and their compositions. However, as end users, we often wish to synthesize specific concepts from our own personal lives.</description>
