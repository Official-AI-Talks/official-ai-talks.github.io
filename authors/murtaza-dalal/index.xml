      <description>Speaker Murtaza Dalal is a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Ruslan Salakhutdinov. His research is on machine learning for robotics, specifically enabling robot agents to learn and perform long-horizon manipulation behaviors.
Abstract Enabling robots to execute temporally extended sequences of behaviors is a challenging problem for learned systems, due to the difficulty of learning both high-level task information and low-level control. In this talk, I will discuss three approaches that we have developed to address this problem.</description>
