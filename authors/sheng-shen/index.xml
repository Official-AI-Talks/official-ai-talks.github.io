      <description>Speaker Sheng Shen is a fourth-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Kurt Keutzer and Prof. Trevor Darrell. His research interests focus on compute-optimal (multimodal) language modeling, including efficient training/tuning methods, model compression techniques, and the integration of vision-language models. He received the Lotfi A. Zadeh Prize in 2023. Prior to UCB, he obtained a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Peking University.
