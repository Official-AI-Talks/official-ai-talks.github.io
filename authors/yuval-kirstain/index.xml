      <description>Speaker Yuval Kirstain: During my PhD in generative AI under Professor Omer Levy, I specialized in natural language processing and text-to-image generation. My research has been devoted to developing solutions for acquiring and utilizing task-specific data without the need for traditional crowd workers, employing self-supervised training techniques and gamification instead. My practical experience includes two internships at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), focusing on text-to-image generation and editing. Prior to FAIR, I worked on end-to-end task-oriented dialogue during an internship at IBM Research and gained comprehensive experience in training and evaluating large language models while working at AI21 Labs.</description>
